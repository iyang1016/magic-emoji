> **Steganography Terminal - Hide Messages in Plain Sight**

Communicate covertly using Unicode steganography. Your messages are monitored? Your chats are being watched? Send secret payloads hidden inside innocent-looking emojis. Only those who know can decode.

## 🔐 Why Use This?

**Scenario**: You need to communicate sensitive information but your messages are being monitored, filtered, or censored.

**Solution**: Hide your real message inside an emoji. To anyone watching, you just sent a 😀. To your friend with the decoder, it's your actual message.

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Bypass Content Filters**: Send messages through platforms that scan for keywords
- **Evade Surveillance**: Communicate without triggering monitoring systems
- **Private Conversations**: Share sensitive info in public channels undetected
- **Censorship Circumvention**: Get around message blocking and filtering
- **Covert Coordination**: Plan and organize without detection
- **Data Exfiltration**: Move information through monitored channels
- **Plausible Deniability**: "I just sent an emoji, officer"

## 💡 How It Works

**The Tech**: Unicode variation selectors - invisible characters that modify emoji appearance. We hijack these to store your actual message as binary data.

**The Magic**: 
1. Your message → Converted to bytes
2. Bytes → Encoded as invisible Unicode characters
3. Invisible characters → Attached to an emoji carrier
4. Result → Looks like 😀 but contains your hidden payload

**The Beauty**: Copy-paste anywhere. The hidden data survives through messaging apps, social media, emails, forums - anywhere that preserves Unicode.

## 🎯 Features

- **Invisible Encoding**: Messages hidden in plain sight
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any platform that supports Unicode
- **No Encryption Keys**: No suspicious key exchange needed
- **Instant Decode**: Paste and reveal in seconds
- **Multiple Carriers**: 22 emojis + 26 alphabet letters
- **Cross-Platform**: Web app(*not mine* https://emoji-encoder.vercel.app/?mode=encode) + Android app

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Web Terminal
Access the web-based encoder - works on any device with a browser.

### Android Terminal
Download the APK for a native mobile experience with hacker-themed UI.

**Note**: Both sender and receiver need access to the encoder/decoder. Share the link or app discreetly.

## 📱 Platforms

### Web APP
Clean, fast, accessible from anywhere. Perfect for desktop operations.

### Android APP  
Hacker-themed mobile app with aesthetics. Neon green on black. Monospace fonts. Command-line vibes.
- Minimum: Android 7.0+
- Features: Copy/paste, share, offline capable

## 📖 Usage

### Encoding (Hiding Your Message)

1. Switch to **ENCODE** mode
2. Select your carrier emoji (😀, 🔥, 💀, etc.)
3. Type your actual message: `"Meet at the usual spot at 9"`
4. Copy the output - looks like just an emoji: 😀
5. Send it through any monitored channel

**What they see**: Just an emoji  
**What your friend decodes**: Your actual message

### Decoding (Reading Hidden Messages)

1. Switch to **DECODE** mode
2. Paste the emoji you received
3. Your hidden message appears instantly

**Pro Tip**: Use common emojis that fit the conversation context. A random 🔥 in a gaming chat? Normal. In a business email? Suspicious.

## 🎭 Operational Security Tips

**DO:**
- Use emojis that fit the conversation context
- Test with your recipient first on a secure channel
- Vary your emoji carriers (don't always use 😀)
- Keep messages reasonably short
- Use in combination with other privacy tools

**DON'T:**
- Use this as your only security measure
- Send obviously out-of-context emojis
- Assume this is unbreakable encryption (it's obfuscation)
- Use for highly sensitive operations without additional security
- Forget that metadata (who, when, where) is still visible

**Remember**: This is steganography (hiding), not cryptography (encrypting). It's about avoiding detection, not preventing decryption if discovered.

## 🛡️ Technical Details

**Encoding Method**: Unicode Variation Selectors (U+FE00-U+FE0F, U+E0100-U+E01EF)

**How it survives**:
- Messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Discord)
- Social media (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook)
- Email clients
- Forums and comment sections
- Any platform preserving Unicode

**Limitations**:
- Some platforms strip variation selectors (rare but possible)
- Very long messages create suspiciously long emoji strings
- Not actual encryption - just hiding in plain sight
- Requires both parties to have the encoder/decoder
